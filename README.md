# Neural Texture Enhancement

A deep learning based solution for enhancing game texture quality. This project aims to generate high-fidelity textures from low-resolution inputs using multi-view consistent neural networks.


1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-texture-enhancement.git
cd neural-texture-enhancement
```



## Data Preparation

1. Prepare your dataset with the following structure:
```
data/processed/
├── sample1_rgb.png     # RGB image
├── sample1_depth.png   # Depth map
├── sample1_normal.png  # Normal map
├── sample1_uv.png      # UV map
├── sample1_gt.png      # Ground truth
└── ...
```

2. The data processing pipeline expects:
- RGB images: 3 channels, RGB format
- Depth maps: Single channel, normalized
- Normal maps: 3 channels, RGB format
- UV maps: 2 channels
- Ground truth: High-resolution RGB images

## Training

1. Configure your training parameters in `configs/texture_enhancement.yml`

2. Start training:
```bash
python scripts/train.py
```

3. Monitor training:
- Logs are saved in `experiments/texture_enhancement_v1/`
- Visualize progress with TensorBoard:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir experiments/texture_enhancement_v1
```
